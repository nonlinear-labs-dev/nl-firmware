Installer  Error Codes / LogFile outputs / cause		2020-02-27 ASCHM
(document for internal use only)

Most of these error codes are diagnostic and were introduced for debugging and normally never occur in a user's situation,
unless something is really wrong like a corrupt/wrong install package ("by design") or a severe file system error on the BBB's SD-Card,etc.

Historical Error and Warning Messages
------------
Errors which may actually occur in a user situation are:
- 41 :: "E41 audio update: cannot connect to ePC" ==> pinging the ePC failed, ePC is off or network connection broken
- 33 :: "E33 RT update: cannot connect to playcontroller, details:" ==> the "mxli" progging tool could find the chip or failed programming it,
can happen occasionally when the playcontroller doesn't run because the clock oscillator didn't start up for some reason.

If these errors occur they also indidcate a potentially unstable C15 which needs repair anyway, as both errors make the C15 inoperable,
no sound (even there is no indication to the user because UI is still running correctly).
E41 is really prone to happen with older C15-hardware (using Supervisor-uC firmware version older than 3.x) when the power button isn't used
in a conservative fashion because the older firmware doesn't protect against this.

These errors also cause the display message "update error! please retry." at the end of the install process.
Often, a reboot and following new install run fixes these problems because those are typically non persistent hardware glitches.
Because of this (non-fatal errors), they also do not initiate a recovery to the previous system state at the end of the install
like most other errors do, and there is no backuped data for ePC and playcontroller anyway.


------------
Warnings which may actually occur in a user situation are:
- 50 :: "W50 UI update: Warning, this UI has been successfully installed before. Quit without installing." ==> Warning only, not displayed
- 10 :: "W10 backup/restore: Warning, data for \"$VERSION\" already backed up" ==> Warning only, not displayed.
        A previous run of an 1811a Installer did already backup the previous (pre-1811a) state

Both of these Warnings will be found in the log file only, they are not displayed on the C15. Both warnings will occur when a user runs
an 1811a Install more than once.



------------
Complete List:
0. Installer script
"Fatal system error! Contact Nonlinear Labs." (no code number, and also not written to logfile)
This error is displayed when the attempt fails to fix very old system where the Playground isn't a Symlink. It indicates
a severe problem (file system error etc)

In general, there might be errors that will display a number not listed here, typically this are syntax errors in the scripts.


1. UI (BBB)
- 50 :: "W50 UI update: Warning, this UI has been successfully installed before. Quit without installing." ==> Warning only, not displayed
- 52 :: "E52 UI update: installing new UI failed (missing/corrupted files)" ==> PG and/or BBBB executables missing / corrupted files
- 53 :: "E53 UI update: installing new UI system services failed" ==> something went wrong while patching "systemd" services

2. Audio Engine (ePC)
- 41 :: "E41 audio update: cannot connect to ePC" ==> pinging the ePC failed, ePC is off or network connection broken (can happen occasionally)
- 42 :: "E42 audio update: file write failed" ==> copying the .ens file failed (permission rights of share, etc)

3. Saving/Restoring C15-Presets
- 60 :: "W60 presets: no data to backup/restore"  ==> Warning only, not displayed
- 61 :: "E61 presets: no action given" ==> call to presets.sh didn't pass a parameter
- 62 :: "E62 presets: no version given" ==> call to presets.sh didn't pass a version string (for naming the temporary folder)
- 63 :: "E63 presets: illegal action given" ==> call to presets.sh didn't pass neither "--backup" nor "--restore"
- 64 :: "E64 presets: could not backup data for \"$VERSION\"" ==> copying the files failed for some reason
- 65 :: "E65 presets: restore failed for \"$VERSION\"" ==> copying the files failed for some reason

4. Saving/Restoring System Files and UI
- 10 :: "W10 backup/restore: Warning, data for \"$VERSION\" already backed up" ==> Warning only, not displayed.
        A previous run of an 1811a Installer did already backup the previous (pre-1811a) state
- 11 :: "E11 backup/restore: no action given" ==> call to backup.sh didn't pass a parameter
- 12 :: "E12 backup/restore: no version given" call to backup.sh didn't pass a version string (for naming the persistent folders)
- 13 :: "E13 backup/restore: illegal action given" ==> call to backup.sh didn't pass neither "--backup" nor "--restore"
- 14 :: "E14 backup/restore: No backup \"$VERSION\" present" ==> no data found to restore
        (most likely trying a restore without previous backup)

6. System Files
- 21 :: "E21 system update: installing new update installer script failed" ==> most likely a severe file system error, etc
- 22 :: "E22 system update: installing new system scripts failed" ==> most likely a severe file system error, etc
- 23 :: "E23 system update: installing new system services failed" ==> most likely a severe file system error, etc

7. u-boot:
- 71 :: < no message text> ==> the remounting of the newly prepared internal flash failed (severe error)
- 72 :: < no message text> ==> remounting was succesfull, but the local saving/restoring of preset stored previously on the tha flash failed.
u-boot update is a special case, if errors occur it writes its own logfiles "uboot.stdout.log" and "uboot.stderr.log" on the USB-stick
which are only useful for in-house diagnostics (expert knowledge required)
