	When defined, this checks whether sensed ePC active indicator did change state
	after actuating ePC power button. If it didn't change, something is
	wrong and system LED shows an Error Pattern. 
	Check is performed after the initial start-up wait time (~20sec).
	Also, after start-up the signal is periodically checked and
	an Error pattern is displayed on LED when not present.
