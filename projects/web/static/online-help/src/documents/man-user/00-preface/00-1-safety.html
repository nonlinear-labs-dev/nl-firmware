        </h3>
        <p>Please use only the included power adapter. If this is not possible, obtain a power adapter with the following specifications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>18 - 20 V DC</li>
            <li>2.5 A or higher</li>
            <li>Plug inner contact: 2.5 mm (+)</li>
            <li>Plug outer contact: 5.5 mm (-)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do not use a power adapter with different or unknown specifications, as this may electrically damage the device! You use a non-original power adapter at your own risk. Nonlinear Labs is not liable for damage caused by use of non-original power adapters.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Do not place the C15 on a soft surface (pillow, mattress, etc.) as this can block the circulation of air to the device while it is being used.</p>
        <p>The C15 is an electrical (and electronic) device: do not allow water to come into contact with it.</p>
        <p>Do not open the C15. The inner parts of the instrument compose an intricate network which is easily damaged and potentially hazardous for inexperienced users.</p>
        <p>Do not use the C15 in extreme ambient temperatures. Stable performance cannot be guaranteed in very hot or cold conditions. Also avoid high humidity and other difficult conditions.</p>
        <p>Always wait for the device to shut down completely before you disconnect its power supply. Do not disconnect the power supply during performance. Doing so can cause data to be lost.</p>

        <h3>Pedal Integration</h3>
        <p>The C15 provides four <span data-keyword="Pedal Connectors"></span> (TRS sockets) allowing for the integration of external pedal controllers. As pedal controllers come with a wide variety of different behaviors and functionalities, there are a few things to consider in order to integrate them correctly.</p>
        <p>The <a href="./documents/man-pedals/index.html" class="label">Pedal Manual</a> will guide you through every step and aspect of connecting and setting up a pedal controller to the C15. Use it to avoid invalid integration of pedal controllers, which may lead to overheating or permanently damaging the C15.</p>
        <p>Once your pedal controllers are safely connected to the C15 and fully operable, it makes sense to explore them as a part of the <span data-keyword="Hardware Sources"></span>. In chapter <a href="./documents/man-user/03-basic-concepts/03-00-0-basic-concepts.html" class="label" data-number="3">Basic Concepts</a>, the general modulation concept can be found. Furthermore, chapter <a href="./documents/man-user/05-synth-engine/05-04-hw-sources.html" class="label" data-number="5.4">Using Hardware Sources</a> provides a detailed explanation of Hardware Sources and all their aspects and properties.</p>
