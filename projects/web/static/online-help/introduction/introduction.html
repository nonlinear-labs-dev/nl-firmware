			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			
			<p>The C15 is an instrument for the performing musician, designed for playability and detailed sound editing. Its unique sound character spans from crisp and organic to complex and experimental. The top-quality semi-weighted <span id="idx_keybed"></span>keybed drives a digital synthesis engine responding with a wide spectrum of sound colors and intensities.</p>
<p>As a dedicated real-time instrument, the C15 is built for human control. There are no modulation sources or sequencing modules to create rhythmic patterns — we leave this to the musician. Instead, the C15 is a decidedly responsive instrument which combines high-resolution keys, Ribbons, and pedal inputs.</p>
<p>Every parameter on the C15 can be directly selected by a button. In other words, all functions are software-defined but have a dedicated haptic control surface. In addition, a Graphical User Interface can be displayed and edited on any device that has a browser and Wi-Fi.<br />Like many classical instrument builders, we have chosen wood for most parts of the housing. All other parts are made of steel or aluminum. Along with the excellent keyboard, there is a specially-designed ergonomic (pitch) Bender, two very long touchstrips (Ribbons), and inputs for up to four pedals.</p>
			
			<h3>About the Manual Content</h3>
			
<p>The following chapters refer to different important aspects of working with the C15 instrument. Each chapter tries to exclude the „broader picture“ by focussing only on the crucial related aspects. Nevertheless, this manual attempts to cover as many details as possible.
When using this manual, it may be helpful to first be certain about your aspect of interest, before actually looking something up. The following overview may help clarifying:
</p>

<h4>2. Setting up the C15</h4>
<p>At least for the first attempt of putting all components together, consider reading this chapter describing the whole process.</p>

<h4>3. Basic Concepts</h4>
<p>This chapter outlines a general approach to the C15 instrument, explaining how to perform, how the modulation mechanism works and how everything is organized.</p>

<h4>4. User Interfaces</h4>
<p>This chapter explains how to actually work with the instrument. Methods of navigation, editing and preset access are described in detail for each available interface.</p>

<h4>5. The Synthesis Engine</h4>
<p>All signal- or DSP- related aspects are subject of this chapter, including details on signal synthesis and flow, tutorials as well as details on the integration of Hardware Sources.</p>

<h4>6. Setup (C15 System Settings)</h4>
<p>When already familiar with the instrument, the setup chapter provides insight into the advanced system settings of the C15.</p>

<p class="note">Keep in mind that the HTML Manual provides some external links to the web, such as the Nonlinear Labs download section, for example. However, these links will only work when an internet connection is active, which is usually not the case when accessing the HTML Manual by using the C15 Graphical User Interface (because the connection is already in use for the Wi-Fi hotspot, provided by the C15). When connected with the C15, a second Wi-Fi adapter can be used in order to access the internet from the mobile device in parallel.</p>
