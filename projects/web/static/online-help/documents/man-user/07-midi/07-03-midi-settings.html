            <h4>Panic</h4>
            <p>When triggered, the C15's Voice Allocation, Envelopes and Buffer will be reset and an <q>All Notes Off</q> MIDI message will be send on the respective channel(s). As a result, all internal audio and external gear will stop playing. A common method to face stuck MIDI notes, but it also can be helpful, when you lost control of the sound, e.g. through a feedback loop.</p>
            <p>Panic can also be triggered by pressing all four soft buttons on the base unit at the same time.</p>
            
            <h4>Local Enable</h4>
            <p>When set to <q>Off</q>, both the C15's keyboard and the eight Hardware Sources are disconnected from the synth engine but still can be used to send MIDI note and Control Change, Pitchbend or Channel Pressure messages.</p>
            <p>In this mode the base unit display is not showing the associated Macro Control, but the MIDI-CC number assigned to the Ribbons instead.</p>
            
            <div data-highlight="note">Please note that changing this setting while a note is active resets the voice allocation, the envelopes and the buffer of the C15, so that the audio playback is interrupted for a brief moment. In this case, a MIDI All Notes Off message is also sent on the respective channel(s).</div>

            <p><i>Next to this shorthand option, Local Enable modes are individually available for Notes and all eight Hardware Sources, see below (7.3.3 MIDI Settings: Routings).</i></p>

            <p>Here you can assign the Preset Bank that is used for sending and receiving MIDI Program Change messages. By selecting <q>None</q>, no MIDI Program Change messages will be received or sent. Please see the next subchapter <q>Choosing a Bank for MIDI Program Change</q> for choosing a Preset Bank directly from the preset view.</p> 
            <div data-highlight="note">Please note, that every time you change the Program Change Bank, a corresponding MIDI message is sent.</div>
            
            <h4>Choosing a Bank for MIDI Program Change</h4>
            <p>To make use of MIDI Program Change messages one of the C15's preset banks has to be assigned as the source and target of Program Changes. A received Program Change would select the preset with the referring number in this bank and the selection of a new preset in the bank will send a MIDI Program Change with its number. Selecting a preset that has a higher number than 128 will not send a Program Change.</p>
            <p>The <q>Direct Load</q> switch decides if the C15 only sends a MIDI Program Change when you select a preset, or if the preset is also loaded into the sound engine. Therefore it has a similar effect like a <q>Local Off</q> for Program Changes.</p>
            <figure class="border maximize" data-label="Bank Program Change Indicators (Graphical UI)">

            </figure>
            <p>The header of the MIDI-assigned bank is marked by a symbol that looks like a 5-pole MIDI connector. The bank can be connected or disconnected in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the graphical UI you find the entry <q>Connect Bank to MIDI PC</q> or <q>Disconnect Bank from MIDI PC</q> in the context menu of the bank header.</li>
                <li>In the Preset Screen of the Hardware UI activate the <q>Bank</q> focus by pressing the <span data-keyword="Soft Button">1</span> (with a dual preset hold the button for a second). In the <q>Edit</q> menu you find the entry <q>MIDI PC: On</q> or <q>MIDI PC: Off</q>, that can be toggled by the <span data-keyword="Enter">Button</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By connecting a bank to MIDI PC the previously connected bank will be disconnected. After disconnecting the currently connected bank, none of the banks will be connected. The currently assigned bank can also be found and changed in the <q>Program Change Bank</q> menu in the MIDI Settings.</p>

                    <p>Here you can select the MIDI channel that is used to send and receive MIDI messages for both Primary and Split Channel.

            <p>These settings determine which types and numbers of MIDI messages are assigned to the Hardware Sources. High Resolution options for Velocities and Hardware Sources as well as a Bank selector for Program Changes are also provided. The Assignments apply to both MIDI Send and MIDI Receive.</p>
        
            <h4>Pedal 1, 2, 3, 4</h4>
            <p>Each pedal can be assigned to a MIDI Control Change. The CC numbers 1 to 31 are available for continuous operation in 7-bit and 14-bit (High-Res.) mode. In 14-bit mode a second CC with a number between 33 and 63 is automatically assigned for the LSB.</p>
            <p>In addition, the CC numbers 64 to 69 are available. They work as 2-state switches, as it is typical for e.g. a MIDI sustain pedal. When the C15's pedal position rises above 50 %, a MIDI CC value of 127 is sent, when it falls below 50% a value of 0 is sent. A received MIDI CC value smaller than 64 sets the pedal position to 0 %. Values of 64 or larger set the pedal position to 100 %.</p>
            <p>By selecting <q>None</q> the pedal is disconnected from MIDI.</p>
            
            <h4>Ribbon 1, 2</h4>
            <p>Each ribbon can be assigned to a MIDI Control Change. The CC numbers 1 to 31 are available in 7-bit and 14-bit (High-Res) mode. In 14-bit mode a second CC with a number between 33 and 63 is automatically assigned for the LSB.</p>
            <p>By selecting <q>None</q> the ribbon is disconnected from MIDI.</p>
            
            <h4>Bender</h4>
            <p>In the typical application as a pitch bender the Bender can be assigned to MIDI Pitchbend. This has 14 bits resolution by definition.</p>
            <p>The Bender can also be assigned to a MIDI Control Change. The CC numbers 1 to 31 are available in 7-bit and 14-bit (High-Res) mode. In 14-bit mode a second CC with a number between 33 and 63 is automatically assigned for the LSB.</p>
            <p>By selecting <q>None</q> the Bender is disconnected from MIDI.</p>
            
            <h4>Aftertouch</h4>
            <p>The most common assignment would be MIDI Channel Pressure. This has only 7 bits of resolution.</p>
            <p>Aftertouch can also be assigned to a MIDI Control Change. The CC numbers 1 to 31 are available in 7-bit and 14-bit (High-Res) mode. In 14-bit mode a second CC with a number between 33 and 63 is automatically assigned for the LSB</p>
            <p>Two additional options are available to assign Aftertouch to one half of the MIDI Pitchbend. <q>Pitchbend up</q> has a range from the center to the maximum while <q>Pitchbend down</q> goes from the center to the minimum. These ranges have 13 bits of resolution.</p>
            <p>By selecting <q>None</q>, Aftertouch is disconnected from MIDI.</p>
            
            <h4>High-Res. CCs (use LSB)</h4>
            <p>Control Changes can be transmitted with a resolution of 14 bit by using two CCs, one for coarse (MSB) values and one for fine (LSB) values. The LSB message has to be sent before the MSB message. The number of the CC for the LSB is derived from the number of the CC for the MSB by adding 32.</p>
            <p>To avoid conflicts with other applications of the LSB CCs, their use can be disabled (q
                Off). This setting applies to all assigned MIDI Control Changes.</p>
            
            <h4>High-Res. Velocity (CC 88)</h4>
            <p>Note On and Note Off velocities can be transmitted with a resolution of 14 bit by sending a CC 88 message before each Note On or Note Off message. The value of the CC 88 represents the LSB that is providing additional 7 bits of resolution.</p>
            <p>To avoid conflicts with other applications of CC 88, its use as velocity LSB can be disabled (<q>Off</q>).</p>

            <p>These settings allow to set individual and specific MIDI routings. The matrix consists of five columns: <q>Send Primary</q> (SP), <q>Receive Primary</q> (RP), <q>Send Split</q> (SS), <q>Receive Split</q> (RS)  and <q>Local</q> (L). The rows list <q>Notes</q>, <q>Program Change</q> and the eight <span data-keyword="Hardware">Sources</span> (Pedal 1-4,  Bender, Aftertouch and Ribbon 1-2. In the Web UI, a check mark at the respective matrix position sets the entry to <q>On</q>, removing the check mark sets it to <q>Off</q>.</p>
            <p>On the hardware, a highlighted entry represents <q>On</q>, a dark one <q>Off</q>. Also, the access to the matrix is different on the hardware. When you choose one of the rows and press <span data-keyword="Enter"></span>, you reach a dedicated settings dialog for this row. In the center, the display shows you the name of the respective component, e.g. <q>Notes</q>. Use <span data-keyword="Soft Buttons">2</span> and <span data-keyword>3</span> to change between the rows. With <span data-keyword="Soft Button">4</span>, you can switch between the columns. The name of the actual column is also displayed below the chosen row, e.g. <q>Send Primary</q>. By turning the dial, you can set the entry to <q>On</q> or <q>Off</q>. When holding the <span data-keyword="Shift">Button</span> while turning the dial, you can set the whole row to <q>On</q> or <q>Off</q>. The status is also displayed by the check marks on the right side. By pressing <span data-keyword="Soft Button">1</span>, you get back to the matrix overview.</p>

                    <h4>Send (Primary/Split)</h4>
                    <p>When set to <q>Off</q> the respective C15 component will not send MIDI messages on the respective channel.</p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <h4>Local</h4>
            <p>When set to <q>Off</q> the respective component is disconnected from the synth engine, but still can be used to send MIDI note and Control Change, Pitchbend or Channel Pressure messages.</p>
            <p>In this mode the base unit display is not showing the associated Macro Control, but the MIDI-CC number assigned to the Ribbons instead.</p>

            <p>Decoupling a Hardware Source from the synth by setting Local Enable to <code>Off</code>, changes their representation in the UI.</p>

                    <p>The Hardware Source is now shown differentiated into <q>Send</q> and <q>Receive</q>.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><q>Send</q> shows the physical status of the respective Hardware Source, for example the current position of a Ribbon and relates to all communication with external devices. This value is sent via MIDI.</p>
                    <p><q>Receive</q> assigns the value that is passed internally to the synth. This is either a value received via MIDI or, in the case of the bidirectional Ribbons, a value received via an adjusted Macro Control. This allows the audio engine of the C15 to be triggered by an external device and at the same time the Hardware Sources can be used to control other external devices without conflict.</p>
            
            <h4>Set all Routings to On/Off</h4>
            <p>Below the Routings Matrix, you find the options to enable or disable all routings by pressing <q>Set all Routings to On</q> or <q>Set all Routings to Off</q> (respectively <q>All On</q>/<q>All Off</q> in the <span data-keyword="Graphical">UI</span>).</p>
        </div>

        <div data-highlight="note">Please note that changing the routings setting while a note is active resets the voice allocation and the envelopes of the C15, so that the audio playback is interrupted for a brief moment. In this case, a MIDI All Notes Off message is also sent on the respective channel(s). </div>
