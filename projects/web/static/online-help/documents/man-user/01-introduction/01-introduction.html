        <p>The C15 is an instrument for the performing musician, designed for playability and detailed sound editing. Its unique sound character ranges from crisp and organic to complex and experimental. The top-quality semi-weighted keybed drives a digital synthesis engine which responds with a wide spectrum of sound colors and intensities.</p>
        <p>As a dedicated real-time instrument, the C15 is built for human control. There are no modulation sources or sequencing modules to create rhythmic patterns - we leave this to the musician. Instead, the C15 is a decidedly responsive instrument which combines high-resolution keys, ribbons, and pedal inputs.</p>
        <p>Almost every parameter on the C15 can be selected directly by pressing a button. In other words, while all functions are software-defined, they have a dedicated haptic control surface. In addition, a <span data-keyword="Graphical"> User Interface</span> is available, which can be displayed and edited on any device with a browser application and Wi-Fi. Like many classical instrument builders, we have chosen wood for most parts of the housing. All other parts are made of steel or aluminium. Along with the excellent keyboard with monophonic <span data-keyword="Aftertouch"></span>, there is a specially-designed ergonomic (pitch) <span data-keyword="Bender"></span>, two very long <span data-keyword="Ribbons"></span> (touch-strips), and inputs for up to four <span data-keyword="Pedals"></span>.</p>

        <h3>About this manual</h3>
        <p>The following chapters refer to different important aspects of using the C15. Each chapter excludes the broader picture by focussing only on the crucial related aspects.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the manual attempts to cover as many details as possible. When you use the manual, it is best to be sure you have identified the subject you are interested in before you look something up. The following overview explains how the manual is structured:</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that the HTML Manual provides some external links to the web, such as the Nonlinear Labs download section, for example.</p>
            <p>However, these links will only work when an internet connection is active, which is usually not the case when accessing the HTML Manual by using the C15 <span data-keyword="Graphical"> UI</span> (because the connection is already in use for the Wi-Fi hotspot, provided by the C15).</p>
            <p>When connected with the C15, a second Wi-Fi adapter can be used in order to access the internet from the mobile device in parallel.</p>
