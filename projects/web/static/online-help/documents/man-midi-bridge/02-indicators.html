        <p>Each port side has a RGB (true color) LED indicator which shows both the <i>port status</i> and the <i>packet status</i> while a packet is running through. Each port LED is referring to the incoming data on that port.</p>
        <p>The LED color basically indicates the port status, which is the largest latency range measured in recent packet delivery (ranging some seconds back).</p>
        <p>The LED is temporarily flashing brighter when an actual packet is running through the device and the color indicates the current latency.</p>

            <p>Because the actual transfer times are normally very short (&lt; <i>100μs</i>) they are lengthened for display. Still the short true transfer time is directly indicated with even brighter colors, and notably the normal green color gets brighter and more cyan’ish when very dense traffic is present. In normal MIDI operation the traffic is very sparse, though.</p>

        <div data-highlight="note">
            <p>As long as you see any LED indicator activity (steady-state on or blinking) the device is powered up and consumes electrical current. Therefore, to save power, you may want to unplug the device from computers while those are in standby, hybernate or power-down modes but still apply supply voltage to their USB sockets.</p>
