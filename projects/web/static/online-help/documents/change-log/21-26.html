        <div data-highlight="note">
            <p>The C15 gets a major update that includes USB MIDI connectivity and an internal digital audio recorder. For connecting the C15 directly to a computer we are offering a new small hardware device called the <a href="./documents/man-midi-bridge/index.html">MIDI Bridge</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Again this update continues the constant evolution of the C15 since its launch. Last summer we extended the synth engine by <span class="keyword" data-keyword="Split"></span>, <span class="keyword" data-keyword="Layer"></span> and <span class="keyword" data-keyword="Mono"></span> modes, new parameters and added more <span class="keyword" data-keyword="Macro">Controls</span>.</p>
        <p>The current implementation of a <span class="keyword" data-keyword="MIDI"></span> interface is now widening up the spectrum of applications for the C15, especially in the studio environment.</p>
        <p>The second feature included in this software release is an internal digital recorder. It automatically stores the audio output signal of the last hours in the C15.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>The USB host interface of the C15 can be directly connected to USB MIDI devices.</p>
                <p>The C15 has a Type A connector for USB, and its embedded computer system works as a <q>USB host</q> for <q>USB devices</q> connected to this port. This means that you only need a standard USB cable to set up a MIDI communication with an instrument, a hardware sequencer, or a MIDI interface, or any device with a USB Type B connector.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>To use the classical MIDI cables and 5-pin DIN Ins and Outs a USB MIDI interface can be connected as an USB device directly to the USB port of the C15.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>As classical MIDI operates on 7 bit resolution (128 steps), there is a loss in accuracy. The C15 operates on much higher precision. Nevertheless, precision can be maintained by enabling the <q>High Resolution</q> options.</p>

        <h3>MIDI Bridge - Connecting the C15 to a Computer</h3>
        <p>For the connection to a computer we provide the MIDI Bridge. It allows high speed transport of MIDI messages between two USB hosts.</p>
        <p>A computer running a DAW or similar is the center of many setups. It functions as a USB host and can only be connected to USB devices. Since the C15 is also a USB host we provide the <q>MIDI Bridge</q> that functions as a double-sided USB device with two Type B connectors. One of the ports is connected to the C15 and the second to your computer.</p>
        <div data-highlight="note">
            <p>For more information, please refer to the <a href="./documents/man-midi-bridge/index.html">MIDI Bridge Manual</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Internal Audio Recorder</h3>
        <p>The internal recorder enables you to capture the C15's output signal with the best possible audio quality at any time, without connecting an audio interface.</p>
        <p>From the browser-based <span class="keyword" data-keyword="Graphical">User Interface</span> you can play back the recorded audio and you can also restore the Synth Engine's state at the time of the play cursor.</p>
        <p>Selected segments of the audio can be downloaded in a lossless digital format and be used directly on your computer in your production environment.</p>
        <p>The stereo signal behind the Soft Clipper and before the D/A converter is written to the RAM, using the lossless compression of the FLAC format (24 bits, 48 kHz).</p>
        <p>A maximum of 500 MB can be stored in the RAM. Because of the FLAC compression this is enough for hours of permanent playing and for days of recording when there are pauses in the playing.</p>
        <p>If the recorded amount of data exceeds the limit of 500 MB, the oldest data will be overwritten. So it works like a ring buffer that always contains the latest recording.</p>
