        <h3>Bundled Documentation</h3>
        <p>The <a href="./index.html">C15 Documentation</a> aims to bundle all available documentation (manuals, info sheets, tutorials, ...) in one single static HTML project.</p>
        <p>By that premise, the whole documentation is organized within a single directory, servable via the official website and/or the embedded NUC. The project structure also aims for github integration in the future.</p>
        <p>Required resources (images, css, javascript, fonts) are contained within the project and are available for all pages. Most resources are structured in a modular fashion.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>Static (but reduced) HTML</h3>
        <p>The project does not use any precompilers, it is plain HTML in combination with (modern) CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <p>The project aims for the support of <b>http</b> (web) and <b>file</b> (local) protocols, so it can also be placed on the USB stick. This however means, that many modern features are not available due to browser restrictions (CORS policies and alike).</p>
        <p>The effort of producing content should be as reduced as possible (avoiding any redundancies if possible). For example, the menu and navigation of documents (or their chapters) is realized by <b>iframe</b> elements, so they effectively are another shared resource. The Table of Contents for all documents and chapters is contained within this single file: <a href="./documents/_content.html" target="_blank">./documents/_content.html</a>.</p>
        <p>Developer information is separated (./developer folder) and hidden by default. When using the Developer Option, those documents (and hidden comments) will become visible/available.</p>
        <p>Specific pages can be printed. The printing format is rather primitie at the moment, but should suffice to print on A4 pages.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>Constant access to Navigation, Responsive design</h3>
        <p>The user should always be able to quickly navigate between documents or chapters. This should not be affected by circumstances like the page scroll position or screen/window dimensions.</p>
        <p>A Menu section provides different means of navigation and access to settings. Using a wide screen, it will be available on the left of the window. On narrow screens, it is available as an overlay and accessable via a menu button on the top-right.</p>
        <p>At any moment, the user should be able to quickly browse different pages.</p>
        <p>The legacy scroll-to-top mechanism is also available.</p>
        <p>Besides, three Color Themes are supported: dark (ignoring system/browser preference), auto (using system/browser preference), light (ignoring system/browser preference). Images are intended to be present in three variations: -dark, -light, -print. (The attribute has to be present in the file name, f.e. image-dark.png) As -print variations are not present at the moment, the -light variation will be taken when printing a page. (Feature is optional and can be set in shared.js)</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>We aim for modern browsers and do not support "historical" pre Web 2.0 stuff. So, CSS3 and Javascript are required.</p>
