			<p>The second effect is called „Cabinet“, providing the possibility to further shape the signal in terms of saturation, overdrive and distortion. It can be regarded as a basic amp simulator.<br /><br />A sine shaper (providing Drive, Fold and Asymmetry, as described for the branch Shapers) is the central element of this effect, allowing for the creation of new harmonics to the signal.<br /><br />Before and after the actual shaping, filtering is applied in order to further manipulate the distortion effect. The signal passes through a highpass filter with adjustable frequency (cutting low signal components) before being fed into the shaper. After the shaping, a lowpass filter with adjustable frequency determines the amount of high signal components (boosted by the distortion).<br /><br />A Tilt parameter has a further influence on the signal spectrum before and after the shaping, as it can emphasize either low or high signal components that will be affected by the shaper.<br /><br />The shaped signal can be amplified by a separate „Cab Level“ parameter, before being crossfaded with the input signal by the Mix parameter.</p>
