    info: >
      Determines the split position of a sound as a key number.
      Keys from the lower end up to the Split Point will be associated to Part I,
      keys from the Split Point up to the upper end will be associated to Part II.
      When linked, both split positions are sticked together and the Split Point behaves as
      one global parameter applying to both Parts.
      When unlinked, the Split Point behaves as two local parameters which can be adjusted separately
      (any MC assignment is still shared, though), allowing for overlapping key ranges.
