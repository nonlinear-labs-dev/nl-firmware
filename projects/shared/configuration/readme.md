# C15 Configuration

An attempt to re-implement (and extend) the "parameter-db" sub-project on a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) basis, providing essential C15 definitions as shared header files (usable wherever they are needed). The current project name is "configuration", as we define more than just parameters here.

## Prerequisites

- required programs: `node` _(currently using v16.15.1)_, `npm` _(8.10.0)_, `tsc` _(4.6.4)_, `g++` _(11.2.0)_
- required node packages: `@types/node @types/js-yaml js-yaml`
- on first run: `npm install` _(the provided package.json should suffice to install the dependencies into the git-ignored `node_modules` folder)_
- `mkdir ./generated` _(the current output directory - which is git-ignored)_

## Run Generation Process

``` bash
bash process.sh
```

## Process Validation

Yaml possesses features for custom tags and validation. However, implementing a validation based on Yaml would result in quite complex and verbose typescript and yaml files, which doesn't seem to provide any benefit. Therefore, the strategy is to perform an additional g++ compilation with the generated headers, which provides validation and raises informative errors when failing.

The process consists of four distinct phases, each of which can fail on invalid input:

1. Typescript compilation _(validating the generation process)_
2. Node execution _(parsing and validating yaml files, generating usable output files)_
3. G++ compilation _(validating generated headers, providing executable based on generated files)_
4. "Main" execution _(additional validation of generated structures)_

## Compatibility with ParameterDb

The content of provided files aims for seamless exchange. However, there is one file in the ParameterDb that is deprecated/removed here:
`parameter_info.h` moved into `declarations.h`. Besides that, the provided and validated code should match the ParameterDb.

## Status

- [x] config.yaml --> config.h
- [x] declarations.yaml --> declarations.h
- [x] handling of several `*.in.*` files
- [x] handling of several definition.yaml files --> definitions.h
- [x] auto-counting of parameters
- [ ] content for java and js resources
- [ ] integration of other shared resources (f.e. nltools) in generated output?

## Roadmap

- [x] working proof of concept
- [ ] complete C15 definition
  - [x] Global: ModMatrix (HW Sources and Amounts, Macro Controls and Times), Master, Scale
  - [x] Split, Part, Unison, Mono
  - [x] Envelopes A, B, C, (G)
  - [ ] Oscillators and Shapers
  - [ ] Comb and SV Filter
  - [ ] Feedback and Output Mixer
  - [ ] Effects: Flanger, Cabinet, Gap Filter, Echo, Reverb
- [ ] "dockerize" project and integrate into make process
- [ ] review:
  - can code be simplified/generalized further?
  - can validation and generation of error messages be more informative?
    - [x] yaml parsing and g++ errors give decent indication of what went wrong
    - [x] typescript validation already does lots of sanity checks
    - [x] parameter definition errors at least provide a filename and reason
- possible project enhancements
  - [ ] integrate clang-format ?
  - [ ] more PlayGround definitions _(descriptors: DisplayScalingType, ParameterGroup)_
  - [ ] provide hw sources as c header for PlayController
  - [ ] generate html artifacts for parameter-reference (manual, webui)?
  - [ ] generate css artifacts _(parameter-group colors)_
  - [ ] potentially delegate Configuration <--> NlTools _(enums: MC, SoundType, VoiceGroup, Preset Messages, Settings?)_
