# YAML Experiments

An attempt to re-implement (and extend) the "parameter-db" sub-project on a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) basis, providing essential C15 definitions as shared header files (usable wherever they are needed). The current project name is "configuration", as we define more than just parameters here.

## Prerequisites

- required programs: node (currently using v16.15.1), npm (8.10.0), tsc (4.6.4)
- on first run (?): `npm init -y` _(as the package.json is part of the repo, an npm install may suffice?)_
- packages: `npm install @types/node @types/js-yaml js-yaml`

## Run Generation Process

``` bash
tsc ./lib/build.ts && node ./lib/build.js
```

## Status
- &#x2611; src/config.yaml, src/config.in.h --> generated/config.h
- &#x2610; src/classification.yaml, src/definitions.yaml --> generated/parameter_delarations.h, generated/parameter_list.h

## Roadmap

- &#x2610; working proof of concept
- &#x2610; "dockerize" project and integrate into make process
- &#x2610; provide process safety (by yaml types) and detailed error messages
