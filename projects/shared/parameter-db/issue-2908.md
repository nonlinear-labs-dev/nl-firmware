### Secondary HW Sources

~~~
When Local is disabled in the MIDI Settings, this control is the
parameter representation of the "Pedal 1" Hardware Source. It
reflects changes that will be sent via MIDI without affecting the
Synth.

This parameter will be visible next to the internal representation
of "Pedal 1" (which reflects changes from the User Interface or
MIDI Input, only affecting the Synth).

Editing the actual "Pedal 1" parameter will not be reflected.

(positive values) of the Attack time by high Note-On velocities.

for higher notes.

### Output Mixer

#### Key Pan

~~~
Amount of key panning for each note (referring to the key position
relative to the center at C3 = 60 semitones). At zero, all notes
are centered in the stereo mix. At maximum, low notes will be 
panned to the left, high notes to the right. At minimum, the opposite 
effect applies.

### Shaper A/B

#### FB - Env C

~~~
Envelope (C) amount for the Feedback Mix. At zero, only a Gate signal
is applied, at higher values, Envelope C is faded in. At negative
values, the Gate signal is faded out, allowing for permanent feedback
at the minimum.
