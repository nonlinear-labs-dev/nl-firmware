    @brief      contains define flags enabling potential dsp improvements

                - primarily attempting to lower permanent cpu usage
                - if possible, maybe reduce some event-related cpu usage as well

                (this file is intended to only be temporary and should be deleted after everything is implemented, tested, decided and cleaned up)

    @todo

// two basic states (disabled, enabled) are provided (disabled refers to the current implementation)

#define __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DISABLED__ 0
#define __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_ENABLED__ 1

// proposal declaration

#define __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__ __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_ENABLED__
#define __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_NUMERIC_TESTS__ __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DISABLED__
// - enable or disable:
//   1) implementations of potential improvements
//   2) numeric tests of chosen implementations

// individual improvements

// COMB IMPROVEMENTS

#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_COMB_REDUCE_VOICE_LOOP_1 __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__
#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_COMB_REDUCE_VOICE_LOOP_2 __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__
#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_COMB_REDUCE_VOICE_LOOP_3 __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__
// - three options, potentially reducing voice loops within the Comb Filter to zero

// DNC IMPROVEMENTS

#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DNC_CONST_OF_ZERO __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DISABLED__
// - first option just as a proof of concept
#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DNC_OMIT_POLYPHONIC __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__
#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DNC_OMIT_MONOPHONIC __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__
// - two further options potentially saving many additions

// PARALLEL DATA SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS

#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PARALLEL_DATA_STD_ABS __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__
#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PARALLEL_DATA_STD_MINMAX_FLOAT __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__

#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PARALLEL_DATA_THREE_RANGES __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL__

    @brief      further dsp-related improvements

    @todo
*******************************************************************************/

// PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS

#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_FAST_PITCH_PROCESSING __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DISABLED__
// - disabled: slow clock / enabled: fast clock for pitches

// FILTER SIMPLIFICATION

#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_OUTMIX_SIMPLE_HP __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_ENABLED__
// - replaces final static mono hp filter in output mix by simpler variation

// GAIN-RELATED SMOOTHING (avoiding clicks)
#define POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_GAIN_CURVE __POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_DISABLED__
constexpr float POTENTIAL_SETTING_GAIN_CURVE_TIME_MS = 1.0f;  // later: migrate to parameter-db
// - introduces a lookup-based s-curve smoothing of gain-related signals (currently at 1ms, smoothing only voice_level for now)
