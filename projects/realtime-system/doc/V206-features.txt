LPC firmware Version 206 (beta V. 63206) (for Milestone 1.7) features:


0) Proccesing changes : 
The last pressed key on the keybed is now sent to the BBB with update BB message "BB_MSG_TYPE_PARAMETER, 12"
(12 is the index for this new "HW_SOURCE" #13)

For other updates on TCD processing etc, ask SSC ;-)



1) Debug LEDs
Order and meaning of LEDs has been changed:
LED A (lower)	green	: CPU Core M0 (fast core) Heartbeat (fast blinking)
LED B		green	: CPU Core M4 (slow core) Heartbeat (slow blinking)
LED C		green	: Audio Unmute (request to Supervisor)
LED D		orange	: Task Overflow (calls to some tasks are still pending when next scheduling is due)
LED E (upper)	red	: Communication Error

"Audio Unmute" is lit as long as Unmute Requests are send to the Supervisor.

"Task Overflow" currently is always indicated when a preset is changed!
The offending task seems to be NL_GPDMA_Poll() which is due every 125uS and gets overrun during a
preset change. Overruns higher than 2 pending calls did not occur in a short test I made,
so this problem seems to be minor, if any.
It might affect (micro-)timing because the task scheduler tries to catch up any calls it could not
make at the proper time points later until all pending calls are made.

"Communication Error" is indicated when :
	- the buffer to hold message data for BBB -- SPI connection -- overruns (BBB not ready), short flash. 
	  Note: buffer is thrown away to avoid stalling.
	- the buffer to hold TCD data for ePC -- USB connection -- overruns, long flash.
	  USB hardware disconnect/reconnect previously stalled the LPC with only hardware reset as a remedy
          but this problem has been fixed now.



2) Ribbon Calibration/Linearization features
A new method to individually calibrate the ribbons has been implemented which also clears the "left side zero error" bug.
Each shipped unit now has hard-coded ribbon calibration tables flashed in memory, as the "default calibration tables"
Additionally, from the BBB, custom tables overriding the defaults can be uploaded to the LPC at runtime (new
BB message "BB_MSG_TYPE_RIBBON_CAL")
See functions "ADC_WORK_SetRibbonCalibration()" and "BB_MSG_ReceiveCallback()" for details.



3) Heartbeat functionality
3a)Heartbeat signal from the Audio Engine is received which is used to signal audio muting to the Supervisor.
The Audio Engine sends its 42bit (unsigned) heartbeat signal every 100ms and it is comprised of a MIDI sequence of three 'Aftertouch' commands,
which must be strictly in order (no gaps with other data in between) :
	- 0xA0 0b0lllllll 0b0hhhhhh	: bits 0..6 (l)   and bits 7..13 (h)  of heartbeat counter
	- 0xA1 0b0lllllll 0b0hhhhhh	: bits 14..20 (l) and bits 21..27 (h) of heartbeat counter
	- 0xA2 0b0lllllll 0b0hhhhhh	: bits 28..34 (l) and bits 35..41 (h) of heartbeat counter
3b) A local heartbeat (64bit unsigned upcounter) is generated and transmitted to the Playground every 100ms so that it can detect
if the LPC was reset or isn't running. This heartbeat is independant to the Audio Engine heartbeat (unlike to the MS1.5 mechanisms).




4) Audio Mute Control and Status
The LPC now sends Mute or UnMute requests to the Supervisor continuously (via a variable duty-cycle square-wave)
which then controls the actual relays. UnMute is signalled when
	- Incoming MIDI traffic over USB was detected at a faster rate than ~ 100ms, meaning that the Audio Engine is up
	- or UnMute detection is overridden by Software Command to LPC
	- or Unmute is unconditionally forced by Hardware-Jumper (shorting GPIO3[1] to GND on Config Jumper Array, left of the LPC).

Further, the supervisor sends its current state of the muting relays back to the LPC as well  (via a variable duty-cycle square-wave).

The BBB can request the current status of the Mute Control via new BB message command "REQUEST_ID_UNMUTE_STATUS" which returns the data
via new BB message "NOTIFICATION_ID_UNMUTE_STATUS".
Also, the BBB can enable/disable the above software override of the muting with
new BB message "BB_MSG_TYPE_SETTING, SETTING_ID_SOFTWARE_MUTE_OVERRIDE".

// bit masks for these functions :
// (for SUP_SetMuteOverride() only *_SOFTWARE_* masks are used/allowed)
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_IS_VALID           (0b1000000000000000)  // status has actually been set
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_JUMPER_OVERRIDE    (0b0000000010000000)  // hardware jumper overriding everything ...
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_JUMPER_VALUE       (0b0000000001000000)  // ... with this value (1:unmuted)
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_SOFTWARE_OVERRIDE  (0b0000000000100000)  // software command overriding midi-derived status ...
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_SOFTWARE_VALUE     (0b0000000000010000)  // ... with this value (1:unmuted)
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_MIDI_DERIVED       (0b0000000000001000)  // midi-derived status ...
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_MIDI_DERIVED_VALUE (0b0000000000000100)  // ... with this value (1:unmuted)
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_HARDWARE_IS_VALID  (0b0000000000000010)  // hardware status is valid (signal from SUP uC was detected) ...
#define SUP_UNMUTE_STATUS_HARDWARE_VALUE     (0b0000000000000001)  // ... with this value (1:unmuted)



5) Raw Sensor Values
The raw sensor ADC values now can be transmitted to the BBB, as an array of 13 uint16 values, with the
new BB message "BB_MSG_TYPE_SENSORS_RAW", useful for debugging and ribbon+bender calibration :
- Pedal Detect Bits for Pedal 4...1 (bits 3..0)
- Tip 1
- Ring 1
- Tip 2
- Ring 2
- Tip 3
- Ring 3
- Tip 4
- Ring 4
- Pitchbender
- Aftertouch
- Ribbon 1
- Ribbon 2
The data is send to the BBB every 12.5ms regardless of any other activity.
By default, the function is disabled to avoid unneccessary traffic.
It can be enabled/disabled by new BB message "BB_MSG_TYPE_SETTING, SETTING_ID_SEND_RAW_SENSOR_DATA"




6) Complete rewrite for External Hardware Controllers (formerly known as Pedal).
See ExternalHardwareControllers_API_V1.0 for details.




7) Complete rewrite of the M0 core stuff, notably the keybed scanner, which now works with 20us cycle
time --> 20us (vs. 150us) velocity resolution.



8) Added service and profiling features



9) Complete Restructuring of the source tree for less overlap, no libraries etc.
